# 📘 AlgoVisualizer

**AlgoVisualizer** is an open-source platform that allows learners and developers to **visualize algorithms** in real-time — from sorting and searching to graph traversal, recursion, and dynamic programming.  
Built with **React + Tailwind CSS**, it aims to make algorithmic concepts more intuitive and interactive.

## 🚀 Phased Roadmap

### 🧩 Phase 1 (MVP) — Core Algorithms
> Focus: Build the foundation with essential visualizations.

#### 🔹 Sorting Algorithms
Visualize how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step.

**Algorithms Included:**
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort  
- Heap Sort  
- Counting / Radix / Bucket Sort  

**Interactive Options:**
- Adjust array size  
- Control visualization speed  
- Choose ascending/descending order  
- Randomize / reverse / nearly-sorted input  

---

#### 🔹 Searching Algorithms
Understand searching logic through dynamic comparisons.

**Algorithms Included:**
- Linear Search  
- Binary Search  

**Interactive Options:**
- Input target value  
- Toggle sorted or unsorted array  
- Highlight comparisons dynamically  

---

#### 🔹 Sliding Window Algorithms
Demonstrate how the sliding window technique optimizes time complexity in problems involving subarrays and substrings.

**Algorithms Included:**
- Maximum Sum of Subarray of Size K  

**Interactive Options:**
- Adjust window size  
- Control animation speed  
- Real-time window movement visualization  
- Dynamic highlighting of elements within the window  
- Step-by-step explanation of window expansion and contraction  

**Algorithm Overview:**
The Sliding Window technique maintains a subset of elements using two pointers (start, end) that "slide" over the array or string to efficiently compute results without redundant recalculations.

**General Approach:**
1. Initialize start and end pointers
2. Expand the window by moving end
3. Process or evaluate current window state
4. Shrink the window from start when constraints are violated
5. Update the result as needed during traversal

---

#### 🔹 Pathfinding Algorithms (Graph / 2D Grid)
Visualize how algorithms explore and find paths across a grid.

**Algorithms Included:**
- Breadth First Search (BFS)  
- Depth First Search (DFS)  
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- A* Search  

**Interactive Options:**
- Set start and end points  
- Add or remove obstacles (walls)  
- Adjust grid size  
- Change heuristics (Manhattan, Euclidean, etc.)  
- Animate traversal vs shortest path separately  

---

### 🧠 Phase 2 — Advanced Visualizations

#### 🔹 Graph Algorithms
Explore advanced graph operations with interactivity.

**Algorithms Included:**
- Kruskal’s & Prim’s (MST)
- Topological Sort  
- Cycle Detection (Directed / Undirected)  
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)  
- Shortest Path (Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford)  

**Interactive Options:**
- Weighted/unweighted graph toggle  
- Directed/undirected toggle  
- Add/remove nodes and edges interactively  

---

#### 🔹 Recursion & Backtracking
Watch recursive logic unfold visually.

**Algorithms Included:**
- N-Queens Problem  
- Sudoku Solver  
- Maze Solver  
- Subset Sum  
- Tower of Hanoi  

**Interactive Options:**
- Step-by-step recursion tree visualization  
- Adjust speed and recursion depth  

---

#### 🔹 Data Structures Visualization
Understand core data structures dynamically.

**Structures Included:**
- Stack (push/pop)  
- Queue / Circular Queue  
- Linked List (insert/delete/traverse)  
- Binary Tree / BST  
- AVL / Red-Black Tree (rotations)  
- Heap (insert/delete-min)  
- Hash Table (collision handling)  

**Interactive Options:**
- Animation speed control  
- Toggle pointer/connection visualization  
- Step-by-step operation display  

---

### 🧩 Phase 3 — Dynamic Programming
Step through **state transitions** and **table updates** interactively to understand dynamic programming intuitively.

**Planned Algorithms:**
- Fibonacci (Top-down / Bottom-up)
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Knapsack Variants  
- Matrix Chain Multiplication  
- Edit Distance  
- Coin Change  

**Planned Features:**
- DP table visualization  
- Subproblem tracing  
- State transition explanations
